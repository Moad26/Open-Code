This has been observed earlier in the context of inflectional languages - for example, nouns can have multiple word endings, and if we search for similar words in a subspace of the original vector space, it is possible to find words that have similar endings [13, 14].\\n\\nSomewhat surprisingly, it was found that similarity of word representations goes beyond simple syntactic regularities. Using a word offset technique where simple algebraic operations are performed on the word vectors, it was shown for example that vector('King') - vector('Man') + vector('Woman') results in a vector that is closest to the vector representation of the word Queen [20].\\n\\nIn this paper, we try to maximize accuracy of these vector operations by developing new model architectures that preserve the linear regularities among words.
